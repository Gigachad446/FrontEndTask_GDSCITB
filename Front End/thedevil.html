    <p>When Joo-yeon has a flat tire on the snow, she calls the tow truck to help her and calls her beloved fianc√© Kim Soo-hyeon, who is a secret 
        agent, to kill time. Out of the blue, a man offers to help her and Joo-yeon refuses. But the man breaks her car, abducts her and dismember 
        her body. Her father, who is a retired chief of police, gives the data of the four prime suspects to Soo-hyeon and he asks two week off to 
        his chief. He hunts the men down and when he finds that Kyung-chul is the killer, he promises a dreadful to revenge against the killer to 
        make him suffer as Joo-yeon did. Soo-hyeon becomes a monster and begins a cat-and-mouse game, capturing and releasing Kyung-chul wounded many 
        times. But the serial-killer is the personification of evil and makes Soo-hyeon regret for not killing him when he had the chance.</p>
