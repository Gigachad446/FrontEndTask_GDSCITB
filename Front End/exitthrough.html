    <p>Banksy is a graffiti artist with a global reputation whose work can be seen on walls from post-hurricane New Orleans to the separation 
        barrier on the Palestinian West Bank. He fiercely guards his anonymity to avoid prosecution. An eccentric French shop keeper turned 
        documentary maker attempts to locate and befriend Banksy, only to have the artist turn the camera back on its owner. Includes footage of 
        Banksy, Shepard Fairey, Invader and many of the world's most infamous graffiti artists at work, on walls and in interview. As Banksy 
        describes it, "It's basically the story of how one man set out to film the un-filmable. And failed."</p>
