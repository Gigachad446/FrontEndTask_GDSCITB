    <p>In 1925, the Duke of York (Colin Firth) is a stammerer and has trouble speaking to the public. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), 
        seeks the treatment of speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) that follows unconventional methods and relationship, and Bertie 
        gives up the treatment on the first day. However, after listening to the session that was recorded by Lionel, Bertie returns to the 
        treatment. In the mid 1930s, the Duke of York is forced to assume the throne of the United Kingdom as King George VI, due to the abdication 
        of his older brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). Immediately afterward, there is a crisis in the government and Britain declares war with 
        Germany. King George VI needs to make a speech to his compatriots, and his friend Lionel helps him using an unorthodox technique.</p>
