    <p>Long-buried secrets are about to come to light, when the twin siblings, Jeanne and Simon, are called before a notary for the reading 
        of their mother Nawal's will. Suddenly, Jeanne is to hand-deliver a sealed letter to the father she never knew, somewhere in the Middle 
        East; likewise, Simon has to give an equally important message to an unknown brother the twins didn't know they had. One is determined 
        to unearth the truth; the other is reluctant. However, a promise is a promise, and, unless the siblings travel to their mother's homeland, 
        they will never find peace. Will Jeanne and Simon honour her dying wish and shed light on Nawal Marwan's terrifying life?</p>
